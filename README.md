 Step-by-Step Instructions:

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Sign in to AWS Management Console and open the S3 service.
Click Create bucket.
Bucket name: Enter a globally unique name, like my-static-website-demo.
Region: Choose the closest region.
Uncheck Block all public access (since we need public access for a website).

Click Create bucket.

Step 2: Upload Files to S3
Go to your newly created bucket and click on Upload.
Add the index.html and style.css files.
Click Upload after confirming the files.

Step 3: Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting
Open the Properties tab in the bucket.

Step 4: Set Bucket Policy for Public Access
Open the Permissions tab and scroll to Bucket policy.
Copy and paste the following JSON policy to make the files publicly accessible:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
